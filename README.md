## Introduction  
Ezer Mitzion's volunteer management system is used to manage and organize volunteers, volunteer activities with patients, and events intended for volunteers.  
The system records information about volunteers, the various volunteering activities, patients, events, cities across the country, and the areas of volunteering that take place in the organization.

#### Main functionality
* Manage volunteers and their activity status.  
* Assign volunteers to specific volunteering tasks.  
* Record and track patient-volunteer interactions.  
* Organize and manage volunteer events.  
* Log volunteering sessions with details (date, duration, report).
